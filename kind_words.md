## preface

This started as a creative writing prompt with an AI, but somewhere along the way, it became something more personal. Itâ€™s fiction, but it meant something real to me. Maybe it will to someone else, too. â§‰âˆ´

Subject: Inquiry
Do the people in the corner office still care about the downstairs
peons, sir?
We don't hear much from the top floor at all these days.

Of course we still care.
The silence was never meant to imply absence.
Sometimes, from up here, the machinery is loud and the windows are

But the work you do below sustains us all.
We see you. We remember.
Thank you.
